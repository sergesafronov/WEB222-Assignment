       <h1>History</h1>
       <p>
        Preference is a commercial card game. The name comes from the French "preference," which translates to "preference, advantage." The term "preference" was used before, but it was used to denote the trump suit in card games. In Preference, players gamble, but unlike gambling games where luck is the main winning factor, Preference emphasizes tactics and the player's skill.<br>
        <br>
        There are only two versions of the game's origin. The first, somewhat surprisingly, is French, and the second is Russian.<br>
        <br>
        The first version speaks of French origins. They say that Preference was invented in France and made its way to St. Petersburg and Moscow during Pushkin's time. From the 1840s, the game started its triumphant journey through the provinces of Russia.

        <h1>Rules</h1>
        <p>
          Playing Preference<br>
<br>
Preference is played by two, three, or four players. When four players are involved, each player takes turns skipping a deal, which is referred to as "sitting out." The game can be played with more players, but in such cases, Preference loses its dynamic nature, and interest wanes as each player is compelled to skip two or more deals in a row. In everyday language, the phrase "play Preference" is often replaced by the expression "write down Pulka."<br>
<br>
The objective of Preference is to accumulate as many points as possible throughout the game. Points in the game are known as "visty." There are several types of visty, each of which is recorded in the player's corresponding area on the Pulka.<br>
<br>
Pulka is a specially marked sheet of paper, divided into three areas for each player.<br>
<br>
- "Pulka" area records points earned for trick-taking games and a bonus for 0 tricks on the распасы if specified in conventions. Each point in the Pulka is worth +10 or +20 visty.<br>
- "Gora" area records penalty points, where each point is worth -10 visty.<br>
- "Visty" area records points earned for tricks during visting. Each point in the "visty" area is worth 1 vist.<br>
<br>
Game Rules for Preference<br>
<br>
A deck of 32 cards is used for the game, ranging from seven (lowest) to ace (highest) in each suit.<br>
<br>
Each round consists of a series of card deals, each involving one of three possible types of games (trick-taking, mizery, распасы). The round continues until the conditions for ending it are met. These conditions may include:<br>
<br>
- Each player has reached a predetermined number of points in the Pulka.<br>
- The players collectively have reached a predetermined number of points in the Pulka.<br>
- A specified time for ending the game has been reached.<br>
- A specified number of rounds of card deals have been played.<br>
- A certain number of points in the Pulka has been reached, and the Gora of all players has been cleared to zero.<br>
The player who deals the cards in the first deal of the round is determined by drawing lots, in subsequent deals, the cards are dealt by players in turn, clockwise.<br>
<br>
The cards are dealt two at a time, clockwise. Each player is dealt 10 cards. The remaining two cards are placed separately in the "prikup." It is advisable to place the "prikup" after the first round of dealing, but in any case, not with the first or last pair of cards.<br>
<br>
If there are 4 players in Preference, the dealer performs the following tasks:<br>
1. In "raspasy" game, the dealer lays out the top card, indicating the lead suit, or does not participate if the "prikup" is not opened in "raspasy."<br>
2. If two opponents playing after ordering a contract pass, the dealer may return the vist by looking at the cards of one of the players and carry out the deal for that player.<br>
3. In a "svetlaya" vist, the dealer has the right to participate in discussing the deal plan on par with the players who visted.<br>
<br>
If 2 or 3 players are involved in the game, the dealer participates in trading and play on common grounds.<br>

Trading<br>
<br>
After the cards are dealt, players engage in trading, which determines the type of game. There are 3 types of games:<br>
- Trick-taking game — one player must take a specific number of tricks, while others strive to prevent it,<br>
- Misery — one player must not take any tricks, while others strive to prevent it,<br>
- "Raspasy" — each player aims to take as few tricks as possible.<br>
<br>
Bids are announced in turn, clockwise. The first bid is made by the player to the left of the dealer. During the bid, the player says either the word "pass," which means refusal to trade, or names the minimum allowed game declaration: from the minimum "6 spades" to the maximum bid "10 no trump," or the word "misery." A player who says "pass" drops out of further trading.<br>
<br>
During trading, the principle of increasing the hierarchy of games is observed. By making a bid different from "pass," a player must declare a game that surpasses the games already declared in hierarchy. The hierarchy of hands is determined clockwise from the dealer in descending order of hierarchy. The hierarchy of games is from 6 to 10, and the hierarchy of suits in ascending order: spades, clubs, diamonds, hearts, no trump. Thus, the sequence of games in increasing hierarchy is: 6 spades — 6 clubs — 6 diamonds — 6 hearts — 6 no trump — 7 spades — 7 clubs — 7 diamonds, and so on.<br>
<br>
A "misery" bid means that a player undertakes not to take any tricks. Such a bid can only be the first and only bid of that player in the current deal and cannot come from a player who has already called a different game or passed.<br>
<br>
If at least one player makes a bid other than "pass," trading continues until two players say "pass." The player who wins the bidding becomes the declarer.<br>
<br>
If all three players in trading say "pass," then "raspasy" games are played.
Trick-Taking Game<br>
<br>
<img src="https://cs11.pikabu.ru/post_img/2020/09/18/3/1600401026199777209.jpg" alt="People play cards"></a>  
In a trick-taking game, the player who won the bidding takes the "prikup" cards, shows them to the other players, and then takes them for themselves. Afterward, they discard two unnecessary cards. These cards are not shown to anyone.<br>
<br>
Then the player definitively announces the trump suit (or lack thereof) and how many tricks they commit to taking. This is called "ordering the game." The player must order a game no less than their last bid during trading.<br>
<br>
The remaining players play against the declarer. Each player decides whether to play (vist) or not play (pass) against them.<br>
Misery<br>
<br>
In a misery game, the player undertakes not to take any tricks. Opponents play openly. Their goal is to force the player to take as many tricks as possible. The player takes the "prikup," shows their cards to opponents, and blindly discards two cards.<br>
<br>
"Raspasy" (No Trump)<br>
<br>
In "raspasy," all suits are equal, and there is no trump suit. Each participant plays for themselves, aiming to take the minimum number of tricks. The "prikup" cards either determine the lead suit for the first two tricks or belong to the dealer, or they are not revealed.<br>
<br>
Playing a Trick (Rozigrish)<br>
<br>
The main action in Preference is playing a trick. Players clockwise, starting with the lead player, place one card each on the table. The lead player sets the suit. The others must play cards of the same suit, trump if they don't have the requested suit, or any card if they don't have the suit or trump. The player who played the highest card takes the trick.<br>
<br>
Scoring<br>
<br>
For each played trick-taking or misery game, the declarer records a certain number of points in their Pulka and deducts a certain number of points from their Gora. The visting player records vists against the declarer.<br>
<br>
Game Completion<br>
<br>
The rules of Preference allow players to stop and settle the contract by agreement at any time, as well as continue the game even after the Pulka is closed. The game can only be prematurely stopped due to very serious circumstances. When playing for money, the number of vists earned is multiplied by a pre-agreed vist value, and players must settle immediately.<br>

        <h1>Tips</h1>
        <p>
          To do well in Preference, a mix of strategy, psychology, and luck, try these tips: First, know the rules well,
          including the types of games and bidding. Watch what opponents do to understand their plans. Think about how
          strong your cards are, considering high ones, suits, and tricks. Get good at bidding, choosing bids based on
          your cards and adapting as others bid. Adjust your approach based on the type of game, like trick-taking or misery.
          Lead with strong cards to control the game early on. Remember the importance of the trump suit and take control if
          you have good trump cards. Signal your partner when visting against the main player. Be careful not to bid too much.
          Trick your opponents with card play that's not what they expect. Predict opponents' moves by watching their bids and plays.
          Stay flexible and change your strategy as needed. Lastly, practice will help you get better over time.
