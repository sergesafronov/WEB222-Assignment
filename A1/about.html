      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        Hi, my name is Segre! It's a pleasure to meet you! I relocated to Canada approximately six
        years ago and have been residing in Toronto ever since. By the way, the picture below
        features me at a fascinating and forbidden mine located somewhere in Boulter, Ontario. It's
        truly an exciting place, I must say.
      </p>

        I was born in the capital city of Ukraine, Kyiv. After completing high school, I pursued my
        passion for cooking by attending culinary college. Becoming a chef was always my dream.
        However, in my hometown, there weren't any universities offering comprehensive programs
        specifically tailored to chef training. I had to choose the closest available option to
        pursue my aspirations. The culinary college taught me the fundamental skills, but nothing
        too extravagant. It was when I secured my first job at a French restaurant that I truly
        learned the art of cooking exquisite cuisine. At the young age of twenty, I even became a
        head chef. My culinary passion paved the way for a successful career as I worked in some of
        the finest restaurants in my city.

        While I deeply love Ukraine, the local economic situation wasn't favorable. That led me to
        make the decision to move to Canada. The immigration process proved to be one of the most
        challenging aspects of my plan, but I eventually succeeded. Allow me to briefly explain what
        prompted me to change my career path. During the immigration process, the pandemic struck,
        limiting my options significantly. However, one industry that remained largely unaffected by
        lockdowns was construction. Consequently, I transitioned into the field of roofing. Many
        perceive it as a difficult and unpleasant job, but I strongly disagree. It can be a
        rewarding profession, especially when working for a reputable company or running your own
        business.

        Nevertheless, this experience served as an eye-opener for me. I realized that there are
        abundant opportunities available, sometimes obscured by our daily routines. It's crucial to
        pause for a moment and take a look around, as we may discover unexpected avenues for growth
        and fulfillment.
